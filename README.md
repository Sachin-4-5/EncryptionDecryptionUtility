# EncryptionDecryptionUtility

## 📖 Overview  
EncryptionDecryptionUtility is a .NET Framework 4.7.2 console-based utility designed to perform symmetric encryption and decryption of textual data using the AES algorithm. The tool provides a simple menu-driven interface that allows users to securely encrypt sensitive information or decrypt previously encrypted data. This utility is ideal for scenarios where quick and local encryption of data is required without relying on external tools or libraries.

## 🔐 Encryption & Decryption in C# – Explained Simply
✅ Layman’s terms explanation : <br />
Imagine you want to send a secret message to a friend, but you're afraid someone might read it while it's being delivered. So, you lock the message in a box (encrypt it) and only your friend has the key to open the box (decrypt it). <br >
Encryption = Locking the message <br />
Decryption = Unlocking the message with the correct key
<br />

✅ Technical definition : <br >
🔹 Encryption & decryption are used to protect sensitive data, like passwords, credit card num, or confidential files. <br />
🔹 Encryption - The process of converting plain text into unreadable text (cipher text) using an algorithm and a key. <br />
🔹 Decryption - Th eprocess of converting cipher text back into readable plain text using the same (or a related) key. <br />

## 🚀 Features  
✅ It uses the secure AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text data. <br />
✅ Menu-driven UI makes it easy to choose between encryption, decryption, or exit operations. <br />
✅ Self-contained and Lightweight - runs as a standalone console application targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2. <br />
✅ Uses a predefined 128-bit key and IV for consistent encryption and decryption (for demonstration). <br />
✅ Handles decryption failures gracefully with user-friendly messages for invalid input or formatting. <br />
